This web app server called "Sound Express" was made using widely-used open source software (including Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB) and applying HTTP protocol elements, including messages, URI, clients, GET and POST requests, servers, and responses, to design and implement my Sound Express app.
Lastly, at the end I created simple security system including identity management, authentication, authorization, and resource sharing, to control access to a my Sound Express app by authorized users.
